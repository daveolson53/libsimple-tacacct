2015-10-26 simple_tacacct  v1.0.0 Dave Olson <olson@cumulusnetworks.com>

	First revision:

	This shared library has is designed to do very simple TACACS+ accounting.
	It is designed to be used via dlopen, and to have a single function.

	The caller calls the routine send_tacacs_acct() with a buffer of the
	"command" to be sent as an accounting record, once with 1 as first
	argument to send a "start" record, and then at the end with 0 as first
	argument to send a "stop" record.

	All configuration is handleed within the library.   See acct_test.c for a
	simple example of the usage.
