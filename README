libsimple_tacacct  v1.0.0
2016-6-22

	First revision:

	This shared library has is designed to do very simple TACACS+ accounting.
	It is designed to be used via dlopen, and to have a single function.

	The caller calls the routine send_tacacs_acct() with a buffer of the "command" to be
	sent as an accounting record, once with 1 as first argument to send a "start" record,
	and then at the end with 0 as first argument to send a "stop" record.

	All config is handed within the library.   See acct_test.c for a simple
	example of the usage.

    The shared library libtac.so is required for communication to the tacacs+
    server (normally provided by libpam_tacplus)

    The common tacacs client configuration file is assumed to be installed from
    libpam_tacplus v 1.3.10 or later (it was formerly a static library).
