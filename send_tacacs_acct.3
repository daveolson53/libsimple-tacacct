.SH NAME
send_tacacs_acct \- send TACACS+ accounting records
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <tacplus/simple_tacacct.h>
.sp
.BI "int send_tacacs_acct(int " taskid ", const char *" cmdmsg );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR send_tacacs_acct ()
sends the command buffer
.I
to a TACACS+ server as an accounting record, and returns the
.I taskid
sent to the server.  The
.I taskid
argument is passed as
.B 0
to indicate the start of a command, and the value returned from the start
call is passed when the command completes, so the tacacs server accounting
will always match start and end of commands, regardless of interleaving.
.P
The TACACS+ protocol limits the accounting record to approximately 240
characters, so the cmdmsg buffer may be truncated in the server log.
.P
Accounting records are only sent if the process is a descendent of
a login process authenticated by a TACACS+ server via the libpam-tacplus
package with the
.BR libtacmap_plus (8)
enhancements.
.P
This is a very simple interface, and the calling program requires very
little modification to use it.  For full control of the accounting, see
the
.B libtac
source that is part of the
.B libpam-tacplus
package.
.SH FILES
.IR  /etc/tacplus_servers --
Lists IP address and shared secret for one or more TACACS+ servers in the form:
.IP secret=string
This is the shared secret used for communication with a TACACS+ server
.PP
.IP server=ipaddr
This is the IP address of a TACACS+ server.
.P
The two keywords above can be in any order, but when multiple servers are used,
they should be listed in pairs (if there are more servers than secrets, and
at least one secret follows the servers, the most recently listed secret is
used).
.br
.IP debug=NUMBER 16
Enables debugging if non-zero
.br
.IP timeout=NUMBER 16
Enables use of poll() when reading from servers if >= 0.  If not set, or set
to a negative value, disables use of
.BR poll (2).
The value is the number of seconds passed as the 3rd argument to
.BR poll (2).
